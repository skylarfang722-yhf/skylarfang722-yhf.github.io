    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this stock picking analysis, I applied a multi-dimensional assessment system using the Finviz screener to find
      fundamentally reliable stocks with reasonable valuation. Based on key ideas from financial statement analysis, I selected
      representative indicators across price, profitability, financial leverage, and liquidity to build an integrated screening framework.
      After screening, I filtered 13 stocks across different industries, suggesting the selected ratio combination does not bias results
      toward a single sector.
    </p>

    <h2>Framework</h2>
    <p><b>Screening logic:</b> choose companies that are reasonably priced, profitable, operationally efficient, financially stable, and liquid enough for short-term obligations.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Valuation:</b> P/E &lt; 15, P/S &lt; 1</li>
      <li><b>Profitability:</b> ROE &gt; 15%, Operating Margin &gt; 10%</li>
      <li><b>Risk control:</b> Debt/Equity &lt; 1</li>
      <li><b>Liquidity:</b> Current Ratio &gt; 2</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These six ratios form a balanced and robust screening method. Together, they target companies with reasonable valuation,
      strong profitability, high efficiency, stable financing, and good short-term financial condition.

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Screened <b>13 stocks</b> across multiple industries (finance, energy, technology, etc.).</li>
      <li>Industry coverage suggests the framework avoids excessive concentration in one category.</li>
      <li>The final output is a shortlist suitable for deeper company-level research.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Case Study 1 — Value Stock: Walmart (Summary)</h2>
    <p>
      I used Walmart as a value-stock example because it reflects stability and long-run competitive advantages rather than rapid expansion.
      Quantitatively, Walmart shows stable profitability and manageable leverage. Qualitatively, it benefits from scale-based cost advantages,
      diversified products, and a loyal customer base, which support stable performance through economic cycles.

    <h2>Case Study 2 — Growth Stock: NVIDIA (Summary)</h2>
    <p>
      I used NVIDIA as a growth-stock example because it matches key growth-investing characteristics: strong future growth potential, high reinvestment,
      competitive advantages, and broad market prospects.
    </p>

    <p><b>Quantitative highlights:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong profit growth and high profitability (high ROE and profit margin).</li>
      <li>Higher P/E is normal for growth stocks when investors price in future earnings expansion.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Qualitative highlights:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Moat:</b> leading GPU technology + CUDA ecosystem creates high switching costs and long-term competitive edge.</li>
      <li><b>Large market potential:</b> positioned in fast-growing sectors such as AI, data centers, cloud computing, and autonomous driving.</li>
      <li><b>Innovation structure:</b> heavy R&D supports continuous product improvement and expansion into new opportunities.</li>
      <li><b>Operational strength:</b> very high profit margins suggest both growth and efficiency.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>What I Would Improve Next</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Automation:</b> rebuild the screener in Python to make the screening reproducible and scalable.</li>
      <li><b>Validation:</b> add a simple backtest or performance tracking vs. a benchmark index.</li>
      <li><b>Reporting:</b> present results in a small dashboard (table + key charts) for recruiter-friendly communication.</li>
    </ul>
